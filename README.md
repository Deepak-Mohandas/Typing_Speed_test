# Typing Speed Test

Have you played a typing speed game? It’s a very useful game to track your typing speed and improve it with regular practice. 

In this Python project idea, I am going to build an exciting project through which you can check and even improve your typing speed.

 For a graphical user interface, I am going to use the pygame library which is used for working with graphics.
